<h2>
    SYNERGY is a rhythm game developed solely by me. I created all of the
    assets, and wrote all of the code.

    The premise is that you slice discs to the beat, and occassionally a second
    cursor will appear that you also need to use.

    During the process of developing this game, I created a plan, prototyped,
    and logged my progress every day.
</p>

<p>
    The game includes one built-in level called "influx". The song was created
    by my friend <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kitefield">Kitefield</a>, and the visuals and level were created by me.

    The game also has a fully functioning feature-rich level editor which lets
    you share and edit levels with other users.
