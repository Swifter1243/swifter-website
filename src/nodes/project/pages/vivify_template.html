            The "Examples" module provides a bunch of scenes and documented
            shaders that walk users through how to implement certain shaders
            effects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some examples include be how to sample lights from the scene, how to
            use grab pass, how to sample the depth texture, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            It also covers how Vivify interfaces with shaders, allowing you to
            create gameplay objects that reflect custom colors and other state
            from the game.

            The "Utilities" module provides some scripts that improve the
            workflow of creating Vivify maps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some examples include Beat Saber compatable shader templates, shader
            functions (math, noise, etc), in-game post processing previews, and
            templates for creating custom gameplay objects.

            The "Exporter" module provides an intuitive window for building to
            Vivify maps. It handles exporting the asset bundle(s) to your map,
            as well as writing the <a
                href="https://github.com/Swifter1243/VivifyTemplate?tab=readme-ov-file#exporter-module"
            >JSON</a> which is parsed by <a
                class="go-to-path-link"
                href="./remapper"
            >ReMapper</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can export using multiple Unity versions at once in the same
            project, and the window automatically handles installing the
            necessary Unity editor, establishing a connection to another
            instance of the editor, and building.
