<h2>
    Excel Software Renderer is an experimental renderer which draws to "pixels"
    in an excel sheet.

<p>
    For an assignment in our python course at school, we were tasked with
    writing some program that utilizes <i>any</i> three python packages. I
    decided this was an opportunity to showcase my knowledge of the graphics
    pipeline, and utilized openpyxl, pywavefront, and numpy to create a software
    renderer.
</p>

<div class="content-row" style="align-items: end;">
    <div class="descripted-item">
        <img src="/excel software renderer/scene.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
        <p>The model inside of Blender.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="descripted-item">
        <img src="/excel software renderer/final.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
        <p>The final render inside of Excel.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    The program would load an obj model using pywavefront, render it, and draw
    it to "pixels" (square cells) in an output Excel sheet.
</p>

<div class="spacer"></div>

<p>The program executes the following steps:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <ol style="max-width: 650px; text-align: left">
        <li>Initialize destination and depth buffers.</li>
        <li>Load the obj file.</li>
        <li>Run "vertex shader" on every vertex.</li>
        <li>
            Project vertices to screen using <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection"
            >Orthographic Projection</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Connect triangle edges using <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm"
            >Bresenham's Algorithm</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Interpolate edges using <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanline_rendering"
            >Scanline Rendering</a> to produce fragments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Discard fragments which are behind objects based on the depth
            buffer.
        </li>
        <li>Run remaining fragments through "fragment shader".</li>
        <li>Write fragments to the depth and destination buffers.</li>
        <li>Finalize destination buffer to excel sheet.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="spacer"></div>

<p>
    The program isn't really performant or practical, but it was a fun
    experiment to learn how to render objects from beginning to end. In the
    future I could improve this program with things like perspective projection,
    triangle clipping, frustum culling, and more.

    My professor didn't know how to run the program but gave me a 100% anyway.
