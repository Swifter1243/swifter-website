<h2>
    EnvironmentGrabber is a tool I made inside of Beat Saber which allows users
    to snapshot moments in custom levels and keep them as a playable
    environment.
</h2>

<p>
    It utilizes <a class="go-to-path-link" href="./remapper">ReMapper</a> to
    parse the beatmap files and interpret community made data which effects how
    the environment is displayed. More information about how it functions is
    available in the project source.

I have also provided a <a

>collection of my own environments</a>, taken from <a
    class="go-to-path-link"
    href="./beat-saber-levels"
>all of the levels I have made</a>.
