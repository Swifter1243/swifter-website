<h2>
    Unity Animation Window is a fork of Unity's built-in animation window, which
    implements audio and particle playback.

<p>
    The repository is a fork of <a
        href="https://github.com/forestrf/UnityAnimationWindow"
    >forestrf's Unity Animation Window</a>, which already included some playback
    features.

            The repository I forked from attached it's new playback features to
            the bottom of the hierarchy, and it was getting a little crowded.
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew I was going to add some new features to the window that
            wouldn't really fit there anymore, so I created a "Settings" panel
            for all the new settings.

            One of the main reasons I wanted this tool was to sync animations
            with audio playback. Some tools existed, but none of them were as
            robust as having a waveform straight in the window.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also added a customizable BPM guide, audio latency compensation,
            and the ability to offset the audio on a per-object basis.

        <p>
            I found it impossible to make particle lightshows without particle
            playback, so I decided to add some true particle playback which I
            haven't really seen be done before.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter how you move the playhead (play forward or scrub timeline)
            the playback will accurately reflect all particle systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Particles actually play from the point they were last enabled (this
            accounts for parents, too). This is achieved by collecting particles
            and analyzing their context within the animation clip.

    The result is a seamless and accurate audio and particle animation tool,
    which accelerated my ability to create audio-visual experiences.
