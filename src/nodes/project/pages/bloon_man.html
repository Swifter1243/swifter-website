<p>
    BLOON MAN, a platformer where you navigate a dangerous bouncy castle as a
    man made of balloons. Avoid sharp, spiky obstacles to keep bloon-men such as
    yourself safe as you find your escape.

            I was responsible for creating a lot of effects to make the game
            feel visually reactive, utilizing scripting and Unity's particle
            systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some examples of effects I worked on are door locking sequences,
            lock breaking effects, projectile impact particles, and level
            transitions.

            We used prefab variants with Unity's Tilemap system to streamline
            level creation and experiment with what felt right with our
            mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
            I helped churn out about half of the levels in the project in order
            to get a respectable amount of content during the time limit.

            I also created original music for the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to go for something sort of whimsical and triumphant, and I
            think it turned out pretty fun.
