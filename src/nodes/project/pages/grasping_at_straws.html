    Grasping At Straws is a game developed by me for a game jam in 48 hours.

    <p>The first few levels of the game.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>
    The game centers around two cups which you must connect using the various
    pieces in the level. It starts off quite easy, but then extends into the
    third dimension with some pretty intense puzzles.

        <p>
            I created all models in the game myself, since it was against the
            rules to import external assets into the project.
        </p>

        <p>
            I took advantage of the flexibility of creating my own models in
            order to create minimal topology, as well as utilizing <b>vertex
                colors</b> to distinguish strips/lids in the shader.

    <div>
        <p>I also created original music for the game.</p>

        <p>
            I wanted the music to feel like you're trapped in a giant soda
            can (hence the bubbling sounds), while also carrying your
            puzzle-solving momentum through rhythmic stabs.
        </p>

        <p>All sound effects were made by me, too.</p>

            All shaders in the game were made by me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created a simple shader for the straws with simple lighting, as
            well as mixed the vertex colors with the straw color for the strips.
        </p>
        <p>
            All indicators (rotation gizmos, selection outlines) were also
            examples of shaders I had to make from scratch.
