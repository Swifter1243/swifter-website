<p>
    The event was a premiere of two new Beat Saber mods,
    <a href="https://github.com/Aeroluna/Vivify">Vivify</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/Aeroluna/Synapse">Synapse</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Vivify</b> is a mod that adds new functionality to custom levels,
    allowing mappers to utilize Unity's Asset Bundles to instantiate prefabs,
    replace gameplay elements, apply post processing effects, and much more.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Synapse</b> is a mod that allows creators to host and configure networked
    events, managing mod installations for any players who want to join. They
    can then compete on a configured set of custom levels in real time.

    The team spent 3 years creating roughly 40 minutes of custom level content
    utilizing Vivify to premiere to the community through Synapse.

        <p>
            My level for the event, titled <b>"you"</b>, has quickly become a
            community favorite. In a short amount of time, it became the highest
            rated map on the community's custom level hosting site <a
                href="https://beatsaver.com/"
            >BeatSaver</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every visual element was completely created by me, whether it be
            modeling, animating, or custom shaders.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project has been completely <a
                href="https://github.com/Swifter1243/you_map"
            >open sourced</a> as a reference for future mappers using Vivify.

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            I created a Main Menu takeover that shows up when you first launch
            Beat Saber, in order to promote the event with a huge countdown.
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            This asset references many of the custom levels from the event, and
            required animation and shader work from me.
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I had to work closely with the programming of <b>Synapse</b> in
            order to properly integrate functionality of the asset, such as the
            countdown.

    <div>
        <p>
            I also created an intro/outro sequence for the event.
        </p>

        <p>
            The environment work for the intro was done by <a
                href="https://x.com/mawntee"
            >Mawntee</a>, but the subtitle system, vocal processing, and
            animations were all created by me. The subtitle animations were
            generated and parsed from a file I wrote containing line timings.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the outro, I produced an <a
                href="https://soundcloud.com/swifter1243/extra-sensory-ii-outro"
            >original track</a> and created the entire sequence myself. The
            credits required shader work as well as a C# script to generate
            prefabs from a .txt file.
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>
            In order for the team and future mappers to easily create custom
            levels with Vivify, I created a Unity tool called <a
                href="https://github.com/Swifter1243/VivifyTemplate"
            >VivifyTemplate</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This tool introduces an intuitive build window in order to
            streamline building Asset Bundles for your level. It handles
            multi-version headaches seamlessly, allowing mappers to develop for
            multiple platforms in one project.
        </p>

        <p>
            It also comes with an assortment of utilities/examples for creators
            to utilize and reference.

        <p>
            Being a <b>lead developer</b> on the project, I took initiative in
            project management and organization.
        </p>

        <p>
            I often convened with members, discussed goals, and outlined our
            plans for the coming days/weeks. I often went into other projects in
            order to pick up slack to keep things moving along.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually, I even set up a <b>JIRA</b> project to manage the
            workload as we were approaching release.

<p>
    <b>Extra Sensory II</b> was the most successful event in Beat Saber history,
    peaking at around <b>2000 concurrent players</b>. The player count created a
    spike in the game's steam charts.
