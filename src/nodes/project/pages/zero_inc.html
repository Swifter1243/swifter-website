    for a game jam.

    You are a process inside of a computer tasked with wiping a 2.15 GB drive
    manually. Use the space you cleared to install upgrades which help you clear
    the drive faster.

            During development I was mostly in charge of front-end presentation
            and design.

        <p>
            This included formatting our internal upgrades, creating small hints
            in the UI, and creating the grid that the player interacts with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an example of the reload animation I made for the grid which
            I really enjoy watching.

            To give the game a distinct aesthetic, I created the CRT post
            processing effect to make the game really feel like it was being
            played on an old computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The effect is composed of horizontal bloom, scanlines, and curve
            distortion which I wrote in raw HLSL.
