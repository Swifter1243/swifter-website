    ReMapper is my proprietary TypeScript library used to create levels in Beat
    Games' critically acclaimed rhythm game Beat Saber

        <p>ReMapper was created from multiple goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It was originally created to streamline Blender to Beat Saber
                conversion tech I had been developing.
            </li>
            <li>
                I was tired of referencing a multitude of resources to figure
                out how to write/manipulate raw beatmap JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
                I wanted to avoid copy and pasting certain helper functions
                between projects.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>
    ReMapper has basically been a vehicle for me to learn software development
    and architecture.
</h3>
<p>
    I started off coding very naive patterns, and was opposed to type systems
    altogether. Eventually my friend Fern decided to mentor me on the project
    and he helped me get out of my comfort zone and grow into a better
    developer.
</p>

<p>
    I learned how to create abstractions using interfaces and abstract classes,
    how to think about layers and responsibilities, how to structure the project
    to reduce cyclic reference spaghetti, design around patterns the compiler
    works best with, and many other concepts that are invaluable to my software
    development skills.
</p>

<h3>
    After being tested in battle for 4 years, I have learned important lessons
    on how to scale architecture while supporting the needs of a userbase.

            In the early days of ReMapper, it was used primarily to convert
            objects in blender into the very limited set of objects inside of
            Beat Saber.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created an <a
                href="https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper-Blender-Exporter"
            >exporter</a> in python to transfer the quirky blender setup into a
            standardized JSON format which ReMapper would parse into environment
            objects and animation events. It would also pool the objects to
            minimize memory impact and rendering costs.
        </p>

<div class="content-pair-left">
    <div class="descripted-item">
        <img src="/remapper/wall rotate 2 points.gif" style="width: 50%">
        <p>
            Two keyframes are not enough to represent a 180 degree rotation on
            this object.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Beat Saber's objects often had misaligned origins which made the
            conversion very complicated. I had to learn a lot of 3D math
            concepts such as matrices, quaternions, and euler rotations in order
            to make proper transformations.
        </p>

        <p>
            When getting into animations, I also had to generate keyframes when
            necessary and then tackle keyframe cleanup which was a very
            complicated problem to solve. It was a balance between granularity
            and optimization that the user shouldn't really have to think about.

            ReMapper went through many iterations over the last 4 years. Most
            recently there has been 4.0.0, which was a complete rework.
        </p>
        <p>
            ReMapper 4 introduced support for multiple JSON versions, massive
            speed & memory improvements, better async support, and extensive
            support for the tech from <a
                class="go-to-path-link"
                href="./extra-sensory-ii"

<p>
    Since my target audience was anywhere from entry level programmers to
    someone looking to use ReMapper in extreme technical depth, I created a <a
        href="https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper/wiki"
    >wiki</a> that goes into excrutiating depth of every single facet of the
    library.
</p>

<p>
    This wiki covers how to install remapper and setup maps (using the <a
        href="https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper-Setup"
    >command-line</a> tool I developed!), as well as the basic concepts of the
    library all the way down to the nitty gritty details of anything you could
    possibly want to do with it.

<h2>
    Overall, ReMapper has been a massive undertaking which has progressed me
    through many unique challenges in software development.
