    <p>A playthrough of BRLCTAP.</p>
</div>

<p>
    BRLCTAP ("Blood Rushing Like Current Through a Powerline") is an album made
    by my friend <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5VE9SnW6U98iPsLfcQwAMQ"
    >acloudyskye</a>. It has been an extremely influential album to me
    artistically, so I knew I wanted to create experiences using it's songs.

        <p>Somewhere Out There, released on November 30th, 2021.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The first experience I created was for the track <b>Somewhere Out
                There</b>, which was my favorite of the album.
        </p>

        <p>
            Me and my friend Reddek were greatly enjoying this track at the
            time, so we created a rough storyboard for what we wanted in the
            level. He worked on some of the early parts, and my friend Mawntee
            hopped on to do animations for the blocks you hit.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had been working on some technology to turn Blender shapes into
            Beat Saber objects, and I wanted to use this map to introduce the
            community to the potential of this technology. This map was really
            the map where I wanted to prove myself to the community.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Needless to say it worked and became the <b>highest rated level of all
        time</b>, also winning "Modchart of the Year" and "Map of the Year" at
    the <a href="https://bsaber.com/posts/the-beasties-2021-winners"
    >community's award event</a>. It was also met with overwhelmingly positive
    reviews on it's <a href="https://beatsaver.com/maps/1e6ff"
    >BeatSaver page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Somewhere Out There inspired the creation of <a
        class="go-to-path-link"
        href="./projects/tools/remapper"
    >ReMapper</a>, which would be the tool I would use to create the rest of
    the maps going forward.

        <p>Heliov, released on July 11th, 2022.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Next up I wanted to create a map for the track <b>Heliov</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to create a more intentional atmosphere this time; that of
            a dark, post-apocolypic, brutalist and oppressive atmosphere where
            the sense of wonder came from how much larger everything was than
            you. I also wanted to pack 5x more content into the runtime to make
            the world feel more connected and lived-in.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was the most technically complex map I made up until that point,
            with animated environments introducing many optimization problems
            that had to work in tandem with other challenges, such as changing
            fog heights and never moving the player in world space.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    The response to Heliov was divisive, with some preferring the colorful
    spectacle of Somewhere Out There and others preferring the scale and
    ambition of Heliov.
</p>

<h3>
    After that point, I realized I wanted to turn the entire album into an
    experience.
</h3>

<p>
    I knew I wasn't going to be able to do a full blown music video for every
    single track, so I aimed to do at least a unique environment with a
    lightshow for each track, with a few exceptions/surprises.
</p>

<p>
    Someone named <b>Shark</b> already created a map for the track Downfall, so
    I merged my environment into their map. Other than that, I created all the
    new maps from scratch and my friend <b>Phøenix</b> did some work on porting
    my hard mapping to lower difficulties, as well as a guest lightshow on the
    track Off And Away. Shark also helped porting to some lower difficulties.

<p>
    There were also some revisions I wanted to make to Somewhere Out There and
    Heliov, so I released some small updates to those maps as well. After that,
    it was complete!
