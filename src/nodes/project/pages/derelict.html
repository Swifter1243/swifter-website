<div class="spacer"></div>

<p>
    Derelict was created by 6 students over the course of 3 months. That
    includes all of planning, as well as production.
</p>

<p>
    The concept is simple. You are dropped into the interior of an alien ship,
    where you'll find weapons as well as "modifiers". You are able to attach
    these modifiers to weapons to change their behaviour, creating interesting
    combinations.

    <div>
        <p>
            I was responsible for all of the procedural generation systems,
            allowing the layout to be unique each time. All of this was also
            offloaded out of the main thread using <b>UniTask</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The challenge was having pre-shaped rooms with pre-defined doorways,
            while connecting them meaningfully for gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>
            To help with debugging, I also designed a lot of editor gizmos to
            visualize the connection of rooms, as well as a testing tool to
            generate layouts outside of play mode.
        </p>

<div class="content-pair-left">
    <img src="/derelict/inventory.png">

    <div>
        <p>
            I created an inventory system for the player, both on a data level
            and a visual/user level.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was a technical challenge, because every container would store
            items in different data structures (e.g. lists vs arrays).
        </p>

        <p>
            I also made artwork for the inventory so it would fit with the rest
            of the game.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="content-pair-right">
    <img src="/derelict/pause menu.png">

    <div>
        <p>
            I did a lot of the user interface for the game, managing different
            "windows" (e.g. pause window, inventory window, game over popup).
        </p>

        <p>
            I had to ensure their corresponding functionality with the core game
            was implemented properly (e.g. pause window pauses gameplay
            elements).
        </p>

        <p>
            I also did a lot of tweaking of existing UI elements, such as the
            buttons, font style, and tooltip implementation.
        </p>

<div class="content-pair-left">

    <div>
        <p>
            I did a lot of polishing and bug fixing on the game in order to make
            it feel good to play.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the biggest things for polish were the various particle
            effects (shooting, enemy death, special modifier actions... etc.)
            which I set up using a singleton that manages pooled particle
            systems for each effect type.

    <div>
        <p>
            I was tasked with creating detailed, atmospheric rooms for gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>
            I created and placed objects (decals, pipes, lights, wires.. etc) in
            order to create believable rooms with high attention to detail. I
            also adjusted material properties to make the lighting feel right.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to speed up the process of creating varying room shapes, I
            created an editor tool to set the materials of a given room.
        </p>

<div class="content-pair-right">
    <img src="/derelict/title screen.png">

    <div>
        <p>
            I spent a lot of time creating an eye-catching environment for the
            main menu.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was important in particular, because we wanted to be
            interesting from a distance during the Level-Up venue in Toronto.
        </p>

        <p>
            I created the skybox, fire, and sun shaders myself, while also
            creating the ship model using geometry nodes in Blender.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given the <b>Project Manager</b> role, I was responsible for
            managing the scope of the project as well as the responsibilities of
            individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
            To achieve this, we managed a <b>JIRA</b> board as well as a <b
            >Confluence</b>
            project. I was responsible for assessing sprint objectives, breaking
            them down into tasks, and distributing those tasks among the team.
        </p>

        <p>
            At some points, I had to assess features that must be cut, as well
            as ensure that content was being delivered in time.

<h2>Derelict was a favorite among the capstone projects for that year, with some playing it for multiple hours.</h2>
