    <p>An in-game playthrough of Aether.</p>
</div>

<h3>
    Aether was conceptualized over the course of 3 years, and created over the
    course of 300 hours. Nearly every asset (shader, animation, material,
    prefab) was created from the ground up by me.

<h2>My work on Aether</h2>

        <p>
            Every shader effect in the map was created from scratch, allowing
            for a unique utilization of the render pipeline rarely seen in the
            Beat Saber community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most shapes were created through math, allowing for a unique
            artstyle across many complicated effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result was a dense and constantly changing set of visuals that
            would not be possible without careful engineering.

        <p>
            In order to animate the dense contents of the song, I needed to have
            an audio preview in-editor while working on the animation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not many good tools existed that allowed me to work like this, so I
            created a <a
                class="go-to-path-link"
                href="./projects/tools/unity-animation-window"
            >tool to do this myself</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This tool also included particle playback, which allowed me to have
            a true "what you see is what you get" workflow.

    <div>
        <p>
            Due to the upload limitations of the Beat Saber custom level site
            <a href="https://beatsaver.com/">BeatSaver</a>, asset bundles for the experience had to be under 5mb.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using my knowledge of Unity systems and shader effects, I was able
            to bring the final file size of the bundles down to only 2.7 mb.

<h2>Aether was met with incredible reception, many saying it's the best Beat Saber map of all time.</h2>
