    PlasmaShift is a game developed by me and my friends Evan and Josh in 48
    hours for a game jam.

    <p>A short run of PlasmaShift.</p>

<p>
    You are a white blood cell and a foreign virus has attacked your host. Your
    job is to eradicate the virus to the best of your ability.

        <p>
            One thing I took on for this project was creating a lot of visual
            effects to make the game feel interesting to look at.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of an effect I worked on was this "bullet" sprite that
            comes from the alien virus. I wrote the shader myself using HLSL.

        <p>
            Another fun effect I made were these alien cells. I used voronoi
            noise and some nice colors in a custom shader to make them feel very
            vibrant and odd.
        </p>
        <p>
            This cell (lovingly nicknamed 'Jeff'), also utilizes a fun cube
            shuffle animation I made using a script.
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="content-pair-left">
    <img src="/plasmashift/background scroll.gif" class="landscape-media">

    <div>
        <p>
            I also created all background elements. The background is composed
            of a fleshy 'sky' layer, as well as two foreground layers which move
            at different paces in order to create a sense of scale from the
            parallax.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vein models I created are endlessly being spawned, moved, and
            discarded when they head offscreen to allow the game to feel like
            it's progressing forever.
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="content-pair-right">
    <img src="/plasmashift/boids.gif" class="landscape-media">

    <div>
        <p>
            As a fun experiment, I decided to implement the boids algorithm into
            the movement of the cells in the background.
        </p>
        <p>
            I use Unity's collider system to create a 'neighborhood' for the
            cell, reducing the complexity of each individual boid.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to three rules of the algorithm (separation, alignment,
            and cohesion) the cells will steer away from the borders of the
            screen.
