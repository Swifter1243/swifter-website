    It originally released in 2021, but after some struggling with the
    publisher, it was taken offline to be released independently. <br>
    I was hired as a <b>Technical Artist & Programmer</b> to help rebuild the
    project.

        <p>
            For this project, I took all of the old environments and moved them
            into the new project with updated visuals.
        </p>

        <p>
            I utilized Unity's ShaderGraph to create a standard Lit shader for
            the project, as well as a few other shaders, like my stylized water
            shader.
        </p>

        <p>
            I additionally adjusted lighting, added subtle fog and smoke VFX,
            and made other tweaks to add to the feel of the environment.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

    <div>
        <p>
            The original game's environments only had a fixed length, so I
            created a system to procedurally fit chunks of the environment
            together as the song goes on.
        </p>

        <p>
            It automatically hides and spawns pieces (with a nice little
            animation) and always ensures you start at the start piece and end
            at the end piece.

        <p>
            Since we were targetting a full framerate on standalone mobile
            headsets, I needed to pivot from realtime to baked lighting for the
            environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            This introduced some problems with the dynamic environment chunks,
            but after looking into how baked lighting works in Unity, I created
            a system that transfers the lightmap data to the instantiated
            pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            I learned how to effectively utilize baked lighting, fixing broken
            UVs and balancing memory footprint with fidelity.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    I was responsible for some small gameplay polish and features around the
    game, which required an understanding of the large codebase, and was an
    introduction to Dependency Injection. For these features, I had to sometimes
    create proprietary shaders along with script behavior to control the
    visuals.

        <p>
            During this project, I learned how to use <a
                href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.3/Documentation/Manual/UIElements.html"
            >UI Toolkit</a> to create functional UI views. Since I was also
            creating <a
                class="go-to-path-link"
                href="./my-website"
            >this website</a> at the time, I was able to easily understand how
            to create dynamic layouts and styles.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also learned how UI Toolkit binds with the underlying scripting,
            creating efficient UI flows that efficiently updated elements using
            an event based approach.
