<h3>
    Hey, I'm Elijah. I also go by "Swifter".
</h3>

<p>
    I am a programmer/artist who has been creating online since 2015. I'm known
    for creating visually striking and polished experiences that also require
    careful engineering.
</p>

<p>
    While I have been creating, I've established myself as a notable figure in a
    handful of communities. Namely the <a href="https://beatsaber.com/"
    >Beat Saber</a> community, where I have become one of the most popular level
    creators/modders that have pushed the game to it's limits.

<h3>
    I am driven by the deep desire to demystify the world around me, such that I
    know every step involved to make something function.
</h3>

<p>
    This extends all the way into the roots of my personality, <i>and would
        annoy my parents considerably when I was little.</i> From watching shows
    like "How It's Made", to reading books about what to do with no materials
    alone in a forest, to now building this very website from the ground up, I
    love to deeply understand how everything fits together.
</p>

<p>
    This has driven me to multiple fields of computer science, such as gameplay
    programming, graphics programming, system architecture, and some audio
    design. I have a wide variety of skills <a
        class="go-to-path-link"
        href="./skills"
    >which are all documented on this website</a>.
</p>

<h3>
    I'm motivated by impact, and creating experiences that will stick with the
    audience.
</h3>

<p>
    What drives me is creating magic for viewers that will change them a little
    bit after experiencing it, like some media has done for me.

    <p style="padding: 20px">Some of the most influential media to me!</p>
</div>

<p>
    For me, media like this allows me to escape into imaginary worlds and
    feelings. Daydreaming has always been a part of the human experience I value
    greatly, and experiences that compliment that have always held a special
    place in my heart.
</p>

<p>
    I'm always chasing that feeling and wanting to spark it in other people.
    Best case, something I make will inspire someone and be the thing that
    causes them to break into a medium that they fall in love with like I have.
